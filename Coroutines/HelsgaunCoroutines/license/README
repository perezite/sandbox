COROUTINE is a portable C++ library for coroutine sequencing. The facilities of the library are based on the coroutine primitives provided by the programming language SIMULA. 

Two different implementations of the library are provided together with libraries for process-oriented discrete event simulation, random drawing, backtrack programming and handling of two-way lists.

The code is distributed for research use. The author reserves all rights to the code.
